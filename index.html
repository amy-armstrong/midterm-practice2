                    Time travel is an interesting concept in theory and the age-old question of whether 
                    a person would rather travel to the past or the future is one that has been highly debated. 
                    Topics such as technology / inventions, fashion, culture and more can be taken into 
                    consideration.

        <h3>Traveling to the Past</h3>

                    Traveling to the past is better because of experience, insights, prevention, and greater 
                    understanding. In the past, experience historical events firsthand and gain deep insights 
                    into history that aren't captured in textbooks. There is also a potential to correct past 
                    mistakes, prevent disasters, or change personal regrets. In the past, there is a chance to 
                    better understand cultural roots and historical evolution going forward.
                    The future is risky to travel to because of ethical dilemmas about knowing future events 
                    (like life or death outcomes) and whether you should intervene. The future is unpredictable, 
                    and things could change unexpectedly. Even in the future, there could still be potential 
                    paradoxes if your actions change the course of events. Therefore, the past is better to time 
                    travel to.

        <h3>Travelling to the Future</h3>

                    Traveling to the future is better because of advancements, improvements, less risk, and opportunities. 
                    In the future, you can gain advanced knowledge, witness technological advancements, and experience breakthroughs in areas 
                    like medicine and space exploration. You can also potentially improve your personal life by avoiding future mistakes; 
                    there is no risk of changing history, as the future remains open. 
                    There are many opportunities for scientific exploration and understanding future developments which 
                    can improve various aspects of life.

                    Traveling to the past can be risky because of time paradoxes: Even small changes could dramatically alter the future (e.g., the "grandfather paradox"). 
                    Ethical issues of altering history and deciding where to draw the line. Limited modern knowledge and conveniences in the past, 
                    and revealing future information could disrupt timelines.

                    Traveling to the future may be less risky in terms of paradoxes but comes with uncertainty and ethical challenges. 
                    Traveling to the past has a higher risk of altering events but offers valuable opportunities to change the present by understanding and correcting history. 
                    Overall, time travel, whether to the past or the future, is a really interesting topic of debate and conversation.
