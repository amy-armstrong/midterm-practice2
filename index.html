                    Time travel is an interesting concept in theory and the age-old question of whether 
                    a person would rather travel to the past or the future is one that has been highly debated. 
                    Topics such as technology / inventions, fashion, culture and more can be taken into 
                    consideration.

                    Traveling to the past is better because of experience, insights, prevention, and greater 
                    understanding. In the past, experience historical events firsthand and gain deep insights 
                    into history that aren't captured in textbooks. There is also a potential to correct past 
                    mistakes, prevent disasters, or change personal regrets. In the past, there is a chance to 
                    better understand cultural roots and historical evolution going forward.
                    The future is risky to travel to because of ethical dilemmas about knowing future events 
                    (like life or death outcomes) and whether you should intervene. The future is unpredictable, 
                    and things could change unexpectedly. Even in the future, there could still be potential 
                    paradoxes if your actions change the course of events. Therefore, the past is better to time 
                    travel to.
